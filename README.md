<h1>Backend of the diabetes detection website</h1>
<hr>
<h3>This is a part of our project for the 2022 imagine cup challenge!</h3>
<p>In this project, we are trying to help poorer communities by providing a cheaper solution for detecting diabetes. This website is going to be used by people residing in these areas to log their symptoms and write the results of their tests. This information will then be used by a machine learning model to determine whether the user has diabetes or not.</p>
<p>Currently, users can create an account. The backend supports token authorization.</p>
